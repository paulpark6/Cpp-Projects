Classes in C++
    - structure that can contain functions
    - member functions have an implicit this keyword
    - "this" is a pointer to the class the member function is running for

Constructor -> creating new object
Destructor -> Ran when an object is deleted
Copy Constructor -> using an object as the parameter to a new object
Copy Assignment -> setting an object to be equal to another object
Move constructor -> moving data from one object to another when constructing
Move Assignment -> ...

MIL -> member initialization list
    - best to initialize class parameter with MIL
    - Allows const and refernce parameters, and objects with no default constructor to be defined durign construction
    
Copy Constructor:
    - allows another object to be used to define a new object
    - a copy constructor is created by default 

Destructor
    - Methodran when a program goes out of scope
    - Built in destructor calls destructors for all fields that are objects

Copy Assignment
    - Used when reassigning an object to another one
    - using "=" like we declare variable but with object to object

Rvalue refeencefa-spin
    - requires for move contrusctors/assignment
    - similar to lvalues references but for Rvalue
    - at the right side of assignment
    - Designed to avoid needless copiesby referencing a temporary value rather than storing it into a variable

Move constructor
    - used when you want to move all contents of one object into a new one
    - meant to avoid copying data needlessly
